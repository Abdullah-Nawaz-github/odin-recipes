		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>
			Mom made us fried chicken livers because they were cheap, and now the
			convenience stores sell them in the South! Use a fry screen — these things
			can pop and will burn you! Serve with pepper gravy or a packet of chicken
			gravy.
		</p>
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>1 pound chicken livers</li>
			<li>1 egg</li>
			<li>½ cup milk</li>
			<li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon garlic powder</li>
			<li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
			<li>1 quart vegetable oil for frying</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Place chicken livers in a colander; rinse with cold water and drain
				well. Blot dry with paper towels.
			</li>
			<li>Whisk egg and milk together in a shallow dish until blended.</li>
			<li>
				Place flour, garlic powder, salt, and pepper into a zip-top bag; shake
				to combine.
			</li>
			<li>
				Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees
				C).
			</li>
			<li>
				Dip chicken livers in egg mixture to coat, then transfer, one at a time,
				into flour mixture, shaking the bag to coat completely.
			</li>
			<li>
				Gently place coated livers, a few at a time, into hot oil; cover with a
				splatter screen and cook until crisp and golden brown, 5 to 6 minutes.
			</li>
		</ol>
