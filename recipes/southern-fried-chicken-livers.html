		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>
			Mom made us fried chicken livers because they were cheap, and now the
			convenience stores sell them in the South! Use a fry screen — these things
			can pop and will burn you! Serve with pepper gravy or a packet of chicken
			gravy.
		</p>
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
			<li>1 ¼ cups panko bread crumbs</li>
			<li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon ground paprika</li>
			<li>
				4 skinless, boneless chicken tenders, cut into 1/2-inch strips
				lengthwise
			</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a baking sheet
				with aluminum foil and spray with cooking spray.
			</li>
			<li>
				Place egg in a shallow dish. Place panko, garlic powder, onion powder,
				paprika, salt, and pepper into a large zip-top freezer bag and mix well.
			</li>
			<li>
				Dip 2 chicken strips into egg, then place into panko mixture and shake
				to coat. Place coated chicken pieces onto the prepared baking sheet.
				Repeat with remaining chicken.
			</li>
			<li>Spray each chicken tender with cooking spray twice.</li>
			<li>
				Bake tenders in the preheated oven for 7 minutes. Flip and continue to
				bake on opposite side until no longer pink in the centers, about 7
				minutes more. Remove from the oven.
			</li>
			<li>
				Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the
				oven's broiler.
			</li>
			<li>
				Broil tenders in the preheated oven for extra crunch, about 1 to 2
				minutes more.
			</li>
		</ol>
