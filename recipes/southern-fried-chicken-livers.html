		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>
			If you're in need of a kid-friendly dinner that will please even the
			pickiest of eaters, you're in luck. These baked chicken tenders couldn't
			be simpler to make—and they're a healthier option than deep-fried chicken.
			Skip the drive-thru and try this no-fuss dinner that everyone at your
			table will love.
		</p>
		<p>
			There are plenty of reasons to make baked chicken tenders instead of
			breaking out your deep fryer: They require a lot less oil than their
			deep-fried counterparts, which makes them a lighter alternative. Plus,
			this oven-baked method is incredibly easy (not to mention it makes cleanup
			a breeze).
		</p>
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
			<li>1 ¼ cups panko bread crumbs</li>
			<li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon ground paprika</li>
			<li>
				4 skinless, boneless chicken tenders, cut into 1/2-inch strips
				lengthwise
			</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a baking sheet
				with aluminum foil and spray with cooking spray.
			</li>
			<li>
				Place egg in a shallow dish. Place panko, garlic powder, onion powder,
				paprika, salt, and pepper into a large zip-top freezer bag and mix well.
			</li>
			<li>
				Dip 2 chicken strips into egg, then place into panko mixture and shake
				to coat. Place coated chicken pieces onto the prepared baking sheet.
				Repeat with remaining chicken.
			</li>
			<li>Spray each chicken tender with cooking spray twice.</li>
			<li>
				Bake tenders in the preheated oven for 7 minutes. Flip and continue to
				bake on opposite side until no longer pink in the centers, about 7
				minutes more. Remove from the oven.
			</li>
			<li>
				Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the
				oven's broiler.
			</li>
			<li>
				Broil tenders in the preheated oven for extra crunch, about 1 to 2
				minutes more.
			</li>
		</ol>
